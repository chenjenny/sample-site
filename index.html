		<i id="quote-statement">“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.”
			<br><center>― Mark Twain</center></i>

		<h2 id="c-statement">Why is traveling important?</h2>
		<br>
		<h3 id="statementmain"><strong>It Opens Your Mind</strong>
		 Traveling opens your mind because you begin to see how people do things differently than you and still get by. We become so custom to our daily habbit that it becomes our routine. But at other countries it will seem strange depening where you at in the world. As in you do it that way other (countries) will find it weird, same goes the other away around. </h3>
		<br>
		<h3 id="statementmain"><strong>You Get to Experience Different Cultures</strong>The most fun part of traveling is experiencing different cultures. New food, new music, new language, it’s so amazing how different it can be from ours.</h3>
		<br>
		<h3 id="statementmain"><strong> FOOD! FOOD! FOOD! FOOD!!!</strong>
		 Traveling allows you to get away from the food you eat everyday. It remind your senses of all the different things the world has to offer. This is a perfect opportunity to open your mind to different cultures and see what are their popular food.</h3>
		<br>
		<p id="statementmain">There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first time or returning to a favorite place. People of all ages, from all countries, travel to foreign places for many different reasons.One of the traveling benefits is finding and keeping humility. Too often, people get wrapped up in their lives, their daily routine of working, sleeping, eating and living. They become self-absorbed to the point it affects their health, their happiness, and their perspective.Another benefit to traveling is coming to see one’s native country in a different light, in a different way. This is done through being able to compare and contrast home from a foreign location, done most always through traveling. A new perspective may be formed.nother great benefit to traveling is the life experience. Many people in the world do not have the luxury of going to another country for pleasure, or even to another city in their native country for that matter.Traveling gets a person out of their comfort zone, away from all their normal pleasures and comforts and way of doing things.Traveling will be adventurous! to live life to the fullest,and to take the most out of it. We will be able to discover new things, meet new people and experience a completely different life </p>
