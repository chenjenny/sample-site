		<h3 id="statementmain"><strong>Jackson telling us about his blog, Journey Era...</strong>" Journey Era was inspired by a love for adventure and a curiosity for exploration. It was also influenced by a huge fear of the 9-5, the daily grind, and the deadly trap of consumerism. I travel the world, making small amounts of money for photography jobs, social media consultation, and other bits and pieces. The content is 99% our adventures and 1% some travel tips. We write about pretending to know how to travel or think we know what we are doing. The emphasis is on quality images and getting off the beaten path, which separates the blog from a lot of other travel blogs."</h3>
		<br>
		<h3 id="statementmain">Jackson is a digital nomad who is exploring epic locations around the world. He is a Travel, lifestyle, and adventure photography. I really like to capture the moment someone reaches the top of a mountain when that feeling of amazement sweeps over their face, or the moment a cliff diverâ€™s heart stops as they look at the camera while hanging upside down. </h3>

		<h3 id="statementmain"> Jackson started photography in June 2015 and shot for Surfline as a Local Pro for several months as well as freelance assignments. Having traveled extensively throughout America, Australia and Europe, Jackson has had his articles and photography published in Lei Magazine, INHNL, Kikaha Magazine (Island Air) and Hawaii Eco Living.</h3>


		<h3 id="statementmain">With a desire to travel slowly so he can get to know an area and explore places off the beaten path, Jackson uses couch surfing, cheap hotels and sponsored accommodation to be able to travel full-time. He travels and lives a very minimalist lifestyle by carrying only a backpack and camera gear.</h3>
